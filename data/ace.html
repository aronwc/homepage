<h2>ACE Coference Data</h2>
<br>
10/9/09
<br>
<a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig//tests/ace/">ACE</a> is a
NIST maintained collection of news documents annotated with
named-entity, coreference, and relation information. The data is
available through NIST.

In
our <a href="../pubs/culotta07first.pdf">HLT '07</a>
paper we use a non-standard split of the data from
2004. Download <a href="hlt2007_split.tgz">hlt2007_split.tgz</a> to
see the exact split into training and testing files we used in that
paper.
